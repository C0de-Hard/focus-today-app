# Focus on Today 🎯

A daily goal tracker I built to help myself (and hopefully others) stay focused. Set up to 3 goals each day and watch your progress grow!

## What it does

- Add up to 3 daily goals
- Check them off when done
- See your progress with a visual bar
- Everything saves automatically (no signup needed)
- Works on phone and desktop

## Why I built this

I kept forgetting my daily goals or losing track of them. Wanted something simple without all the complicated features of big productivity apps. Just focus on today, that's it.

## How to use

1. Type your 3 goals for the day
2. Click the circles to mark them complete
3. Watch the progress bar fill up
4. Come back tomorrow and repeat

## Tech stuff

Built with basic web technologies:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Uses localStorage to save your stuff
- Google Fonts for the text
- Some SVG icons I found

## Running it

Just download and open `index.html` in any browser. No installation, no setup, no fuss.

## File structure

```
index.html    - the main page
style.css     - how it looks
script.js     - how it works
assets/       - icons and images
```

## What's next

Maybe I'll add:
- Goal history
- Categories
- Dark mode
- Better mobile design

But honestly, keeping it simple is the goal.
